by Akmal Idris and Ji Hoon Kim

2. sql_files is folder containing php files to connect to the database.

3. Use Doxygen to recursively scan for folders in the repo.

4. To run the test code, you must make sure that you've done step 1. Make sure to open all three files in LibraryTrackerProject/src/com.example.librarytracker.test.*/ and run Android JUnit Test on each .java file.
Afterwards open LibraryTracker/src/com.example.librarytracker.MainActivity.java and Run it with the run commmand
at the top of the IDE. During this, the application should automatically load to an emulator or mobile device.
